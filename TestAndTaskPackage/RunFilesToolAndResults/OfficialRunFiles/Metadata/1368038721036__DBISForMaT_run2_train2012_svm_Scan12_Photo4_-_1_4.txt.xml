<methoddescription>SVM Multi-Class classification based six models, one for each category (Leaf, Stem, Entire, Fruit etc.).



Different model was learned on a special combination of multiple visual features like (based on color, edges or textures). We use a straight assignment to each test image to a predicted class.

<otherinformation>run2

- based on computations on the 2012 training+test data using the score computation of ImageCLEF2012

- using the &quot;second best&quot; results (other feature compilation than run1) to reduce overfilling and get results of other features



- data for SheetAsBackground_Leaf:

# computed with epsilon_termination_criterion=0.001 instead of 0.000000001

# nu adapted to new data set (as large as possible)

-- stable (cost=1)  parameter combination with highest score for feature combination &lt;&gt; Photo4
