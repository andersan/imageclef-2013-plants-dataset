<methoddescription>NaturalBackground:
Descriptors Surf, Fourier, EOH, LBP (rotation invariant), ProbRGB,
Histogram HSV on harris points (concentrated towards the center of the
image); for leaf no color is used, for other organs EOH is not used;
each descriptor&apos;s response obtained separately, then all merged using
weighting based on the maximal returned class probability. For flower
database, filtering by date of photograph is applied with a +/- 3
weeks tolerance; dates from train database were used to construct the
flowering periods. All individual image responses for an individual
plant are merged first by organ (using simple argmax for each class),
then by using weigthing based on the maximal organ class probability.

SheetAsBackground:
A multiscale triangulat shape descriptor (Triangle Side Lenghts and an Angle).
400 contour points
5 contour points is the distance betwwen two successive triangles
50 I consider 50 points on each side relative to the central point. (50/5 = 10 scales)
Multi Observations
