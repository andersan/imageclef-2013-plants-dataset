<methoddescription>Linear classification with image vectors, whose features are histograms of parameters:
- Feature extraction consists of contour extraction, partitioning and geometric description (similar as described in IJCV, Rasche 2010). Parameters for an image are then transformed into simple histograms and a single image vector is formed (several hundreds of dimensions).
- Classification is done with a simple LDA with the above described image vectors.
